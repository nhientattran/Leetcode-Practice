# 551. Student Attendance Record I

# You are given a string s representing an attendance record for a student where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:

# 'A': Absent.
# 'L': Late.
# 'P': Present.
# The student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet both of the following criteria:

# The student was absent ('A') for strictly fewer than 2 days total.
# The student was never late ('L') for 3 or more consecutive days.
# Return true if the student is eligible for an attendance award, or false otherwise.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "PPALLP"
# Output: true
# Explanation: The student has fewer than 2 absences and was never late 3 or more consecutive days.
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "PPALLL"
# Output: false
# Explanation: The student was late 3 consecutive days in the last 3 days, so is not eligible for the award.

# 561. Array Partition

# Given an integer array nums of 2n integers, group these integers into n pairs (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) such that the sum of min(ai, bi) for all i is maximized. Return the maximized sum.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,4,3,2]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: All possible pairings (ignoring the ordering of elements) are:
# 1. (1, 4), (2, 3) -> min(1, 4) + min(2, 3) = 1 + 2 = 3
# 2. (1, 3), (2, 4) -> min(1, 3) + min(2, 4) = 1 + 2 = 3
# 3. (1, 2), (3, 4) -> min(1, 2) + min(3, 4) = 1 + 3 = 4
# So the maximum possible sum is 4.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [6,2,6,5,1,2]
# Output: 9
# Explanation: The optimal pairing is (2, 1), (2, 5), (6, 6). min(2, 1) + min(2, 5) + min(6, 6) = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9.
