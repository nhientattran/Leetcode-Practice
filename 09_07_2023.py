# 12. Integer to Roman

# Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

# Symbol       Value
# I             1
# V             5
# X             10
# L             50
# C             100
# D             500
# M             1000
# For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

# Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

# I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
# X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
# C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
# Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

# Example 1:

# Input: num = 3
# Output: "III"
# Explanation: 3 is represented as 3 ones.
# Example 2:

# Input: num = 58
# Output: "LVIII"
# Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
# Example 3:

# Input: num = 1994
# Output: "MCMXCIV"
# Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

def intToRoman(num):
    out = ''
    values = [1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1]
    roman = ['M', 'CM', 'D', 'CD', 'C', 'XC', 'L', 'XL', 'X', 'IX', 'V', 'IV', 'I']
    for i in range(len(values)):
        while num >= values[i]:
            if num > values[i]:
                out += roman[i]
                num -= values[i]
    return out

# 151. Reverse Words in a String

# Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

# A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

# Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

# Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "the sky is blue"
# Output: "blue is sky the"
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "  hello world  "
# Output: "world hello"
# Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "a good   example"
# Output: "example good a"
# Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

def reverseWords(s):
    s2 = s.strip().split(' ')
    s_list = []
    for word in s2:
        if word != '':
            s_list.append(word)
    return " ".join(s_list[::-1])

# 6. Zigzag Conversion

# The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)

# P   A   H   N
# A P L S I I G
# Y   I   R
# And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"

# Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:

# string convert(string s, int numRows);
 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
# Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
# Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
# Explanation:
# P     I    N
# A   L S  I G
# Y A   H R
# P     I
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "A", numRows = 1
# Output: "A"

def convert(s, numRows):
    if numRows == 1 or numRows > len(s):
        return s
    current_row = 0
    direction = -1
    rows = [''] * numRows
    for word in s:
        rows[current_row] += word
        if current_row == 0 or current_row == numRows -1:
            direction *= -1
        current_row += direction
    return ''.join(rows)
