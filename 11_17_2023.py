# 492. Construct the Rectangle

# A web developer needs to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

# The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
# The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
# The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
# Return an array [L, W] where L and W are the length and width of the web page you designed in sequence.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: area = 4
# Output: [2,2]
# Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. 
# But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.
# Example 2:

# Input: area = 37
# Output: [37,1]
# Example 3:

# Input: area = 122122
# Output: [427,286]

def constructRectangle(area):
    width = int(math.sqrt(area))
    while area % width != 0:
        width -= 1
    length = int(area / width)
    return [length, width]

# 495. Teemo Attacking

# Our hero Teemo is attacking an enemy Ashe with poison attacks! When Teemo attacks Ashe, Ashe gets poisoned for a exactly duration seconds. More formally, an attack at second t will mean Ashe is poisoned during the inclusive time interval [t, t + duration - 1]. If Teemo attacks again before the poison effect ends, the timer for it is reset, and the poison effect will end duration seconds after the new attack.

# You are given a non-decreasing integer array timeSeries, where timeSeries[i] denotes that Teemo attacks Ashe at second timeSeries[i], and an integer duration.

# Return the total number of seconds that Ashe is poisoned.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: timeSeries = [1,4], duration = 2
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:
# - At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.
# - At second 4, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 4 and 5.
# Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, 4, and 5, which is 4 seconds in total.
# Example 2:

# Input: timeSeries = [1,2], duration = 2
# Output: 3
# Explanation: Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:
# - At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.
# - At second 2 however, Teemo attacks again and resets the poison timer. Ashe is poisoned for seconds 2 and 3.
# Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, and 3, which is 3 seconds in total.
