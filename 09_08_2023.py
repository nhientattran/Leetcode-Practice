# 167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

# Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 < numbers.length.

# Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

# The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

# Your solution must use only constant extra space.

# Example 1:

# Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
# Output: [1,2]
# Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
# Example 2:

# Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
# Output: [1,3]
# Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].
# Example 3:

# Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
# Output: [1,2]
# Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

def twoSum1(numbers, target):
    out = []
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        sub = target - numbers[i]
        if sub in numbers[i+1:]:
            x = numbers[i+1:].index(sub) + i + 1
            out.append(i+1)
            out.append(x+1)
            return out

def twoSum2(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1

# 11. Container With Most Water

# You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

# Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

# Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

# Notice that you may not slant the container.

# Example 1:

# Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
# Output: 49
# Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
# Example 2:

# Input: height = [1,1]
# Output: 1

def maxArea(height):
    if len(height) == 2:
            if height[0] >= height[1]:
                return height[1] * height[1]
