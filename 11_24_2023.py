# 520. Detect Capital

# We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the following cases holds:

# All letters in this word are capitals, like "USA".
# All letters in this word are not capitals, like "leetcode".
# Only the first letter in this word is capital, like "Google".
# Given a string word, return true if the usage of capitals in it is right.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: word = "USA"
# Output: true
# Example 2:

# Input: word = "FlaG"
# Output: false

def detectCapitalUse(word):
    if word == word.lower():
        return True
    
    if word[0] == word[0].upper():
        if word[1::] == word[1::].lower():
            return True
        elif word[1::] == word[1::].upper():
            return True
        else:
            return False

# 509. Fibonacci Number

# The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

# F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
# F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
# Given n, calculate F(n).

 

# Example 1:

# Input: n = 2
# Output: 1
# Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.
# Example 2:

# Input: n = 3
# Output: 2
# Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.
# Example 3:

# Input: n = 4
# Output: 3
# Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
