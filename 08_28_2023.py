# 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

# You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

# On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

# Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

def maxProfit(prices):
    if not prices:
        return 0
    profit = 0
    for i in range(1, len(prices)):
        if prices[i] > prices[i - 1]:
            profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1]
    return profit

 
# 55. Jump Game

# You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

# Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
# Output: true
# Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
# Output: false
# Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.

        return True

# 45. Jump Game II

# You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are initially positioned at nums[0].

# Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i. In other words, if you are at nums[i], you can jump to any nums[i + j] where:

# 0 <= j <= nums[i] and
# i + j < n
# Return the minimum number of jumps to reach nums[n - 1]. The test cases are generated such that you can reach nums[n - 1].

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [2,3,0,1,4]
# Output: 2
