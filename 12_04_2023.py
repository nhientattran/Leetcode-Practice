# 605. Can Place Flowers

# You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

# Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
# Output: true
# Example 2:

# Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
# Output: false
 
def canPlaceFlowers(flowerbed, n):
    count = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(flowerbed):
        if flowerbed[i] == 0 and (i == 0 or flowerbed[i-1] == 0) and (i == len(flowerbed) - 1 or flowerbed[i+1] == 0):
            flowerbed[i] = 1
            count += 1
        i += 1
    return count >= n

# 599. Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists

# Given two arrays of strings list1 and list2, find the common strings with the least index sum.

# A common string is a string that appeared in both list1 and list2.

# A common string with the least index sum is a common string such that if it appeared at list1[i] and list2[j] then i + j should be the minimum value among all the other common strings.

# Return all the common strings with the least index sum. Return the answer in any order.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["Piatti","The Grill at Torrey Pines","Hungry Hunter Steakhouse","Shogun"]
# Output: ["Shogun"]
# Explanation: The only common string is "Shogun".
# Example 2:

# Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["KFC","Shogun","Burger King"]
# Output: ["Shogun"]
# Explanation: The common string with the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum = (0 + 1) = 1.
# Example 3:

# Input: list1 = ["happy","sad","good"], list2 = ["sad","happy","good"]
# Output: ["sad","happy"]
# Explanation: There are three common strings:
# "happy" with index sum = (0 + 1) = 1.
# "sad" with index sum = (1 + 0) = 1.
# "good" with index sum = (2 + 2) = 4.
# The strings with the least index sum are "sad" and "happy".
