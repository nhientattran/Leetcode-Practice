# 1. Two Sum

# Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

# You can return the answer in any order.

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
# Output: [0,1]
# Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
# Output: [1,2]
# Example 3:

# Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
# Output: [0,1]
 

# Constraints:

# 2 <= nums.length <= 104
# -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
# -109 <= target <= 109
# Only one valid answer exists.

def twoSum(nums, target):
    dic = {}
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        sub = target - nums[i]
        if nums[i] in dic:
            return [dic[nums[i]], i]
        else:
            dic[sub] = i

# 49. Group Anagrams

# Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

# An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

# Example 1:

# Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
# Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
# Example 2:

# Input: strs = [""]
# Output: [[""]]
# Example 3:

# Input: strs = ["a"]
# Output: [["a"]]
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= strs.length <= 104
# 0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
# strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

def groupAnagrams(strs):
    dic = {}
    for word in strs:
        char_list = "".join(sorted(word))
        if char_list not in dic:
            dic[char_list] = [word]
        else:
            dic[char_list].append(word)
    return dic.values()
