# 263. Ugly Number

# An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

# Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: n = 6
# Output: true
# Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3
# Example 2:

# Input: n = 1
# Output: true
# Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
# Example 3:

# Input: n = 14
# Output: false
# Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.

def isUgly(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return False
    
    while n % 2 == 0:
        n /= 2

    while n % 3 == 0:
        n /= 3

    while n % 5 == 0:
        n /= 5
    
    return n == 1

# 278. First Bad Version

# You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

# Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

# You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: n = 5, bad = 4
# Output: 4
# Explanation:
# call isBadVersion(3) -> false
# call isBadVersion(5) -> true
# call isBadVersion(4) -> true
# Then 4 is the first bad version.
# Example 2:

# Input: n = 1, bad = 1
# Output: 1

def firstBadVersion(n):
    left, right = 1, n
    while left < right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if isBadVersion(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    
    return left
