# The input consists of a string, representing the given string for the puzzle.

# Note
# If there are multiple sub-strings of equal length, choose the lexicographically smallest one.

# Input
# The first line of input consists of two space-separated integers-

# The next M lines consist of N space-separated integers representing the elements of the matrix.
# Output
# Print a number which is largest in a row and smallest in a column in the given matrix. If no element is found print '-1'
