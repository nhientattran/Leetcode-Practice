# 367. Valid Perfect Square

# Companies
# Given a positive integer num, return true if num is a perfect square or false otherwise.

# A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

# You must not use any built-in library function, such as sqrt.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: num = 16
# Output: true
# Explanation: We return true because 4 * 4 = 16 and 4 is an integer.
# Example 2:

# Input: num = 14
# Output: false
# Explanation: We return false because 3.742 * 3.742 = 14 and 3.742 is not an integer.
 
def isPerfectSquare(num):
    num2 = math.sqrt(num)
    return num2 == int(num2)

# 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

# We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

# I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

# Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

# You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:

# -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
# 1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
# 0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
# Return the number that I picked.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: n = 10, pick = 6
# Output: 6
# Example 2:

# Input: n = 1, pick = 1
# Output: 1
# Example 3:

# Input: n = 2, pick = 1
# Output: 1

# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if num is higher than the picked number
#          1 if num is lower than the picked number
#          otherwise return 0
# def guess(num):

def guessNumber(n):
    left, right = 1, n

    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        result = guess(mid)

        if result == 0:
            return mid
        elif result == -1:
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid
